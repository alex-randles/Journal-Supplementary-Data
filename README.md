# Journal-Supplementary-Data
A repository containing supplementary information for the submission to the Semantic Web Journal (SWJ)


## /Experiment-1
This directory the mapping quality reports generated by the MQI Framework as named graphs ([experiment_1_reports.trig](./Experiment-1/experiment_1_reports.trig)).The quality reports are represented in the [Mapping Quality Improvement Ontology (MQIO)](https://w3id.org/MQIO). 


## /Experiment-2
This directory contains the R2RML mapping 
([evaluation_mapping.ttl](./Experiment-2/evaluation_mapping.ttl)) 
with 3 quality violations, which 
was used to test the **effectiveness** of the MQI Framework. 
In addition, the quality report 
([evaluation_quality_report.ttl](./Experiment-2/evaluation_quality_report.ttl)) 
generated by the framework and a sample 
refined mapping
([sample_refined_mapping..ttl](./Experiment-2/sample_refined_mapping.ttl)) 
and validation report 
([sample_validation_report..ttl](./Experiment-2/sample_validation_report.ttl)).


## /Experiment-3
This directory contains the RML mapping 
([evaluation_mapping.ttl](./Experiment-3/evaluation_mapping.ttl)) 
related to the input source data ([evaluation_source_data-1.ttl](./Experiment-3/evaluation_source_data-1.csv), [evaluation_source_data-2.ttl](./Experiment-3/evaluation_source_data-2.csv))
, which was used to test the **understanding** of the MQI Framework. 
In addition, the change report
([evaluation_change_log.ttl](./Experiment-3/evaluation_change_log.ttl)) 
generated by the framework detecting changes in the source data. The change reports are represented in the [Ontology for Source Change Detection (OSCD)](https://w3id.org/OSCD). 



#### /Experiment-4
This directory contains the provided document ([MQIO_Document.pdf](./Experiment-4/MQIO_Document.pdf)) and questionnaire ([MQIO_Questionnaire.pdf](./Experiment-4/MQIO_Questionnaire.pdf)), which asked ontology design experts about the design of the 
**MQIO**. 


#### /Experiment-5
This directory contains the provided document ([OSCD_Document.pdf](./Experiment-5/OSCD_Document.pdf))  and questionnaire ([OSCD_Questionnaire.pdf](./Experiment-5/OSCD_Questionnaire.pdf)), 
which asked ontology design experts about the design of the 
**OSCD**.
